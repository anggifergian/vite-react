# Dockerize Vite React Application: Beginner-friendly Guide

### Introduction
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight containers. Containers package your code along with all its dependencies–making it run reliably on any environment.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic Vite React repo (or follow steps below to create one)

## Step 1: Create a Vite + React Project
If you do not have one yet, create a new project:
```
npm create vite@latest vite-react -- --template react
cd vite-react
npm install
```
<br/>
Run it locally to test:
```
npm run dev
```

<br/>
Feel free to modify your Vite React at this stage. You can add [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), [react router](https://reactrouter.com/home), or any other packages.

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
Lets verify first that our Docker enginee is available running:
```
docker ps
```
<br/>
The output should be like this, so we can continue to next step:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```
<br/>
Or if you do not have yet Docker installed on your machine, you can refer to this [page](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) for Docker installation.

Now at the root of your project, create a file named ``Dockerfile``, make sure you named it correctly:
```
# Step 1: Build the app
FROM node:lts-alpine3.20 AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the app with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

EXPOSE 80
CMD [ "nginx", "-g", "daemon off;" ]
```

<br/>
We used ``npm run build`` in order to get production build at ``/dist`` which we will used at next tutorial on deploying our Vite React app.

<br/>
In order to avoid unnecessary artifacts from being included when building Docker images, create ``.dockerignore`` file at the same path as Dockerfile:
```
node_modules
dist
.git
.gitignore
.env*
.vscode
```

## Step 3: Build and Run our React Vite App
First, we will build the image of our app. Run these commands from our project root or at the same path as Dockerfile located:
```
docker build -t vite-react:1.0.0 .
```
<br/>
Check our docker images:
```
docker images
```
<br/>
We will see there is our react vite image:
```
REPOSITORY     TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
vite-react     1.0.0     c38c8801d57c   1 minute ago   49.9MB
```
<br/>
Now we can run the Docker container using the image react vite:
```
docker run -p 4000:80 -d vite-react:1.0.0
```
<br/>
Open our browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:4000
```
<br/>
You should see our Vite React app running!

### ✅ We're Done!
We have just:
- Create a React + Vite app
- Build and running app using Docker

### What's Next?
In the next part of this series, we will setup Github Accounts for CI/CD to automatically deploy this Vite React Dockerize app to our VPS on every code push.
